# Multi-Tenant Inventory & Order Management SaaS Platform

A modern, scalable SaaS platform to manage inventory, orders, and users across multiple tenant companies — built with Next.js, Turborepo, PNPM, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Prisma.

### 🚀 Tech Stack

Next.js (App Router) – React framework for frontend + backend (API routes)
Turborepo + PNPM – Monorepo tooling & package management
TypeScript – Type safety and better developer experience
Tailwind CSS – Utility-first CSS framework for styling
Prisma + PostgreSQL – Database ORM and storage
n8n (optional) – Workflow automation for background jobs and notifications
WebSockets (Socket.IO) – Real-time updates for stock and orders
Auth.js / Clerk / Supabase Auth – Authentication & authorization

### 📁 Project Structure

`...`

### ⚙️ Getting Started

    1. Prerequisites
        Node.js >= 18.x
        pnpm >= 7.x
        PostgreSQL database (local or hosted)
        (Optional) Redis for WebSocket session persistence
        (Optional) Docker (for n8n or PostgreSQL)

    2. Clone repository
        `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-saas-platform.git
        cd my-saas-platform`

    3. Install dependencies
        `pnpm install`

    4. Configure environment variables
        Create .env files in the root and apps/web as needed:
          `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/yourdb?schema=public"
          NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL="ws://localhost:3000"
          JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret"`
          # Add auth provider keys if used (Clerk, Supabase, etc.)

    5. Setup database & Prisma
        Generate Prisma client and run migrations:
          `pnpm prisma generate
          pnpm prisma migrate dev`

    6. Seed the database with sample data
        Run the seed script (located in packages/db/scripts/seed.ts or similar):
          `pnpm db:seed`
        You can use faker.js or similar libraries in the seed script to generate realistic fake data (products, users, orders, etc.).

### 🛠 Key Features to Implement

    * Multi-tenant architecture: isolate tenant data and access

User roles: Admin, Staff with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Product & Inventory management: CRUD, categories, barcodes, stock levels

Order processing: purchase, sale orders, invoicing, PDF export

Real-time stock & order updates: via WebSockets (Socket.IO)

Workflow automation: n8n workflows for alerts, emails, stock replenishment

Authentication & Authorization: using Auth.js/Clerk/Supabase

Responsive UI: built with Tailwind CSS & Headless UI components

### 🔄 Real-time Updates

Implement real-time stock and order updates with WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO):

Use a WebSocket server to push stock/order changes instantly to all connected clients.

Fallback to polling if WebSockets aren’t supported.

Example workflow: when stock is updated, emit an event to update the UI across all sessions.

### 🧪 Seeding and Fake Data

Use faker.js or @faker-js/faker in your seed scripts to generate realistic data.

Seed users, products, orders, and logs for testing and demos.

Consider running background jobs or scripts that randomly update data regularly to simulate live changes.

### 🔁 Simulating Live Data Changes

If you want your data to keep changing like a real app:

Write background scripts or cron jobs to update stock quantities, order statuses, or create new orders periodically.

Use n8n workflows to automate updates or trigger alerts based on DB state or events.

Combine with WebSockets to broadcast changes to connected clients for live UI updates.

### ⚙️ n8n Integration (Optional)

Deploy n8n via Docker or use a managed instance. Create workflows triggered by:

Webhook events from your app (e.g., new order created).

Polling your PostgreSQL DB to detect low stock and send notifications.

Automate emails, Slack alerts, report generation, and CRM sync.

### 🧩 Recommended UI Libraries

Headless UI — unstyled accessible components for full Tailwind customization.

Radix UI — accessible primitives with flexible styling.

DaisyUI — Tailwind-based ready-made styled components.

Using a component UI library speeds up development, ensures accessibility, and provides a polished look without building all UI elements from scratch.

### 🚀 Deployment Suggestions

Frontend: Vercel (best Next.js support)

Backend & DB: Render, Supabase, Railway, or your favorite cloud provider

n8n: Docker on a VPS or managed cloud
